                <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
                <p class="desc-txt">Mechanical keyboards use tiny mechanical devices containing sliders and spring mechanisms, called switches, beneath each key to provide the typist with palpable feedback. The sensation is similar to electrical typewriters of the 90’s and can differ depending on the type of switch used. Cheap, or off-the-mill keyboards often use rubber domes to provide some sort of feedback. The resistance you feel comes from squeezing the rubber dome, which will then expand again, when you release the key. Compared to mechanical switches it is rather “mushy”. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="desc-block">
                <h2>What is a switch?</h2>
                <p class="desc-txt">Firstly, there are many brands of switch manufacturers, the most common and reliable ones are the ones by Cherry, based in germany (you know, german engineering and all that). To not complicate things even further, I will focus just on Cherry MX switches. Each switch contains a mechanism that is meant to provide the “feel”. Compared to rubber dome and laptop keyboards this feedback is crisp and distinct, also quite audible, while the switches provide deeper travel for each key.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="desc-block">
                <h2>How do the switches differ?</h2>
                <p class="desc-txt">There are three main categories of switches (but many more variants):
                    <ul>
                        <li>LINEAR (i.e. Cherry MX RED switches)</li>
                        <li>TACTILE (i.e. Cherry MX BROWN switches)</li>
                        <li>CLICKY (i.e. Cherry MX BLUE switches)</li>
                    </ul>
                    While all three types of switches can be used for any kind of scenario, their intended use-cases are: RED for gaming, because of their ultra-fast-response, BROWN as a competent allrounder and BLUE for typing.</p>
